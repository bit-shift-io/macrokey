# macrokey
A simple c++/python alternative to auto hotkey (AHK). 

# requirements:
Linux

# run
sudo ./macrokey.py {GameName}

Where {GameName} currently can be:
Default - use a default profile
TheForest - specialised left clicking to support cutting down trees in The Forest

# notes
Running the python script will call "make", which should generate macrokey.so. If this step fails then errors will occur
